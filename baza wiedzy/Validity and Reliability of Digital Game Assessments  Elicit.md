# Validity and Reliability of Digital Game Assessments | Elicit

> ## Excerpt
> Digital game‐based assessments of cognitive variables exhibit moderate convergent validity compared with traditional tasks. In eight studies that paired the two methods, correlations ranged from 0.30 to 0.69. One study using an adaptive digital task detected attention deficits with greater sensitivity than conventional tests, and several reports noted reliability metrics—such as Cronbach’s α values above 0.70 and between‐person reliability as high as 0.97—that support sound measurement properties. Across tests of memory, cognitive control, and executive functions, digital and traditional approaches produced comparable statistical associations.
